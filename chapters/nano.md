## Action 

**Biotechnology**



*   [Cambridge Working Group](http://cambridgeworkinggroup.org/): Works to address the risks of Potential Pandemic Pathogen research through promoting public understanding, risk assessment and regulation of such research.
*   [American Biological Safety Association (ABSA)](http://www.absa.org/): Promotes biosafety as a scientific discipline through forums and peer-reviewed journals for biosafety professionals throughout the world.
*   [Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)](http://www.phe.gov/about/barda/pages/default.aspx): Develops and procures needed medical countermeasures (MCMs), including vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and non-pharmaceutical countermeasures, against a broad array of public health emergencies in US.
*   [Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO)](http://www.bio.org/): A trade association representing biotechnology companies, academic institutions, state biotechnology centers, and related organizations around the world. Researches and develops innovative healthcare, agricultural, industrial, and environmental biotechnology products.
*   [Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine](http://www3.cabm.rutgers.edu/home.php): Conducts biomedical and biotech research and development to improve human health.
*   [Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases (CBEID)](http://www.utmb.edu/CBEID/index.html): Addresses and researches important issues in the protection of the US from biological threats, including bioterrorism, biological warfare, and tropical infectious disease
*   [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](http://www.cdc.gov/): The United States government’s center for research, analysis, and detection of new and emerging global health threats. Promotes healthy and safe behaviors, communities, and environments.

**Nanotechnology **



*   [Foresight Institute:](https://foresight.org/) A leading think tank and and public interest organization focused on transformative future technologies. Discovers and promotes the upsides of, and helps avoid the dangers of nanotechnology, AI, biotechnology, and similar life-changing developments
